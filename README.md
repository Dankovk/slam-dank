# Slam-Dank

**Slam-Dank** is a TypeScript-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) solution designed for the browser. While it uses TypeScript for all the core logic, OpenCV.js — with WebAssembly (Wasm) under the hood — is used for efficient image processing and computer vision tasks. This approach keeps everything lightweight while running directly in the browser.

## Core Features

- **Browser Native**: Primarily TypeScript, with WebAssembly handled by OpenCV.js for image processing.
- **Monocular SLAM**: Tracks the camera’s 3D position using a single camera feed.
- **IMU Data Integration**: Incorporates accelerometer and gyroscope data for higher accuracy.
- **Virtual Object Handling**: Enables real-time placement and manipulation of virtual objects in the scene.
- **TypeScript Ceres Solver**: A custom TypeScript-based version of the Ceres Solver for bundle adjustment and optimization.

## Overview

Slam-Dank utilizes OpenCV.js for computer vision tasks while relying on Math.js for mathematical operations. By processing camera frames and integrating IMU data, it estimates the camera’s position in real-time, builds a 3D map, and handles the placement of virtual objects. Loop closure ensures map consistency and accuracy over time.
